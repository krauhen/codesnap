# TODOs

- Extend language support to include not only Python and TypeScript but also documentation files such as Markdown (.md)
  and AsciiDoc (.adox). This will allow the tool to create snapshots of documentation files as well. Additionally,
  implement an ignore list mechanism similar to that used for existing languages.
